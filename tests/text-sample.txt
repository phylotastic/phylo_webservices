PSYCHE. 
ORGAN OF 
THE CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB, 
EDITED BY B. PICKMAN MAW, 
Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., May? 1874. [No. I. 
Introductory. 
THE CAMBRIDGE EXTOMOLOGICAL CLUB was formed 
January 9, 1874, by the following persons, who met at Dr. 
Hagen's house, No. 7 Putnanl Street, Cambridge, Massachu- 
setts, namely: Messrs, E. P. Austin, Edm-ard Burgess, G. R. 
Crotch, of Can~bridge, England, George Dimmock, J. H. 
Emerton, Dr, H. A. Hagen, 3Iessrs. Samuel Henshaw, B. P, 
Mann, H. K. Morrison, J. C. Munro, of Lexington; Dr. A. S. 
Packard, of Salem, Messrs. Eugene Schwarz, and S. H. Scud- 
der. It has since adcled to its number Messrs. J. ,A. Allen, 
Walter F'axon, A. W. Gould, Prof. C. E. Hamh, Messrs. 
Hohes Hinkley, H, G. Hubbard, Baron C. R. Osten Sacken, 
Messrs. F, G. anb born, G. D. Smith, P. S. Sprague, Roland 
Thaxter, of Newtondle, and C. P. Whitney, of Milford, N. H. 
At the fourth monthly meeting, held April 10,1874, the 
Club decided to undertake the publication of a monthly 
organ, to be called PSYCH^. This organ will contain such 
parts of the proceedings of the Club as seem to be of general 
interest, biological contributions upon Arthropods from any 
competent person, lists of captures, with time and locality, 
miscellmeous entomological information, and especially a 
BIBLI~RAPHICAL RECORD, in which last a list will be given 
of all writings upon Entomology published in Korth America, 
and of all foreign writings upon North American Entomology, 
from the beginning of the year 1874, with a brief note of the 
contents of each. For the greater perfection of this list, 
authors and societies are requested to forward their works to 
the editor at the ea~liest date possible. 
Each number will contain at least four pages, and as soon 
as the returns we sufficient to make it possible, a greater 
number of pages will be given. The subscription price in

English Names for Butterflies. 
THE natural objects which attract most attention among 
all classes are birds, butterflies? and flowers. 
In England, 
the native species of all these groups have received common 
English names; and no doubt many persons have thus ac- 
quired a good knowledge of Natural History who might have 
been repelled by scientific Greek or Lat,in con~pounds. 
In 
our own country all the common birds and flowers have also 
received such names, and it is my belief that the st,udy of 
butterflies would be far more popular, if they also had com- 
mon names. 
There would be an advantage, too, in this, for 
Antiopa would be t.he Camberwell Beauty all the same, how- 
ever fiercely men wrangled over Papilio vs;.Vanessa as its 
proper adjunct ! 
In PSYCHE, then, as its appropriate place, we print the fol- 
lowing list of names proposed for New &gland butterflies, 
using as a basis on the- scientific side? the names of rny,Revi- 
sion. Account is taken of all names that have been proposed 
by Gosse and others, and they are retained unless special rea- 
sons prevent.

2. @neb Juttu.- The arctic Satyr. 
3. Enodia Portlandia.- The Pearly-eye.

4. Hinois AZope.- The blue-eyed Grayling.

Ringlet In English parlance.

Collecting in the White Mountains. 
Year after year, entomologists seek the summits of the 
White Mountains of New Hampshire in search of rare insects, 
and the number now known from that region is so great that 
catalogues have already become necessary. Very few persons, 
however, have attempted to separate collections obtained 011 
the extreme heights from those obtained on the lower plateaus 
of the barren region, or at the heads of ravines; yet t'here 
are two well defined districts above the forest limits, and 
although most insects found above the trees are common to 
both regions, specimens of one should not be mingled with 
those of the other. 
With a view of inducing those who visit the mountains 
this summer to help in the formation of distinctive alpine and 
subalpine lists, we offer (by the kind permission of Professor 
Charles H. Hitchcock of the New Hampshire Geological 
Survey) the accompanying map of the White Mountains, in 
which the alpine district is colored red and the subalpine blue. 
The subalpine district is the region of the dwarfed spruce, 
and includes the heads of the deepest ravines ; the alpine is 
characterized by naked, broken masses of rock, excepting on 
the level spots, where sedges conceal them. (Eneis semideu 
is confined to this highest district,

- 
Vernacular Names for Butterflies. 
IT may be that' in England the native species of all classes 
of birds, butterflies, and flowers (and, I trust, of fishes like- 
wise) have received tommon English names. 
My experience is that in continental countries of Europe a 
great many species, such as come under most frequent obser- 
vation of the public, have their common names and often 
three or four different names at a time, each according to 
provincialisms. A popular name of a fish is of acknowledged 
utility in a market, and could not be very well supplanted by 
a scientific one, yet without their scientific names being as- 
certained, there would be little comparison possible between 
markets West and East and those of Europe. The popular 
name under which a plant or butterfly is known cannot but 
have a charm even for a scientific searcher, and ought to be 
remembered by him and promulgated in print. But his task 
is to popularize science by utilizing such names, and by them 
to lead amateurs to awaken to the advantages of scientific 
nomenclature as one that is not provincial, nor exclusively 
English, but cosmological. 
Amateurs cannot possibly take much interest until they 
begin to bring things into groups by their own observations 
of similarities, and later with scientific assistance into genera. 
I want to have genuine popular names (be they ever so 
local, as "Camberwell Beauty" for a butterfly that ranges all 
over Europe and over America to California) distinguished 
from names that are created more or less arbitrarily, or by 
merely translating scientific double names into the vernacular. 
The adoption and promulgation of these latter ones seems to 
me of very doubtful policy, as they do not harmonize with 
the originally popular names and may create, in an amateur's

mind, a greater difficulty of grouping the specimens. A 
White Mountain butterfly (par excellence), a dull-eyed and 
a blue-eyed Grayling, an arctic Satyr, &c., &c., and Camber- 
well Beauty would lead soon to misunderstandings which 
could not be disentangled. 
With reference to the latter, I ask, who here would willing- 
ly adopt such a name for the Antiopa of California? ! Every 
person from Germany greets it here as b6Trauermantel" 
(mourning cloak), and may ask, perhaps, how is it called in 
English ? Could I answer? So with bbAtalanta." The - 
same as at home. our "Admiral??" How shall I name for 
them our five Papiliones, whom they all know as "Swallow- 
tails ?'Pliilenor I name for them the green Swallow-tail. 
Finally, let us remember and always print the "popular" 
names, as a by-gift, but let us abstain from trying to create 
popular names, if it were even by translating the whole of 
Kirby's Catalogue into the vernacular. 
To show that I myself am a lover of popular names, to 
which I always lend an attentive ear, I make free to add 
these following genuine ones, and to ask permission to report 
more from time to time, when memory serves me : 
British Blondes, for the two Coenonymphas ; 
Buckeye, for Junonia Cosnia.

9. Dcriicms Plexippus.- The Monarch. 
D'Urban calls it the Storm Fritillary, but it is not a Fritillary. 
Gosse 
called it the Archippus, but tiis is not its proper name. It is one of the 
largest of our butterflies, and rules a vast domain. 
10. Basilarchia Disippe. - The Viceroy. 
This name is suggested from its mimicry of the preceding species. 
11. Baailarchia Astyanax.- he red-spotted Purple. 
This name was proposed by Gosse. 
12. Basilarchia Arthemis.- The banded Purple. 
Also proposed by Gosse. 
13. Boxocopa Herse.- The tawny Emperor. 
The species of this group are termed- Emperors in England. 
14. Polygonkt interrogationis.- The Violet-tip. 
A name well proposed by Gosse.

9. Dcii?aus Rexippus.- The Monarch. 
D'Urban calls it the Storm Fritillary, but it is not a Fritillary. 
Gosse 
called it the Archippus, but this is not its proper name. It is one of the 
largest of our butterflies, and rules a vast domain. 
10. Basilarchia Disippe.- The Viceroy. 
This name is suggested from its mimicry of the preceding species. 
11. Basilarchin Astyanax.- The red-spotted Purple. 
This name was proposed by Gosse. 
12. Basilarchia Arthemis.- The banded Purple. 
Also proposed by Gosse. 
13. Doxocopa Heme.-The tawny Emperor. 
The species of this group are termed-amp erors in England 
14. Polygonia interrogationis.- The Violet-tip. 
A name well proposed by Goshe.

ARREST OF DEVELOPMENT. 
Mr. B. P. Mann has recently received from 
Florida a caterpillar of "Papilio Cresphontes," in which the front pair of 
prolegs is'greatly aborted. The under surface of the third abdominal 
segment bears a pair of slight mamrniform elevations, each with a sessile 
crescent of booklets ;these can scarcely ever be brought into use, yet they 
are as well developed as usual, and the markings on the side of the 
prolegs show that no part is actually wanting, only all the fleshy parts are 
excessively short. The caterpillar is apparently in the final stage, but 
unfortunately arrived in a dying condition.

GICAL 
ORGAN OF THE CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOi 
EDITED BY B. PICKMAN MANN. 
CLUB. 
- 
Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., August, 1874. [No. 4. 
Early springButterflies at the White Mountains. 
DURING four sunny days (June 2 - 5) spent in the Glen this 
spring, in a search for butterflies, the following species were 
noticed. 
The wild cherries were just blossoming. 
Basilarchia Disippe. 
Two or three larvae were seen on 
poplar, of just the same size as others of the next species near 
them. 
Basilarchia A~themis. The caterpillars were found not un- 
common upon the black birch ; one upon poplar, on the same 
twig with Disippe. 
All had left their hibernacula, which pre- 
cisely resemble those of the preceding species, and had moulted 
at least once ; the first moult almost invariably takes place on 
their emerging from winter quarters, as proved by the pelliele 
left upon the tip of the leaf forming the hibernaculum. A& 
search for the caterpillar was the principal object of my visit, I 
must have examined nearly five thousand plants of black birch ; 
the result proves that the eggs are laid almost exclusively upon 
horizontally extended branches of small plants not more than 
two or three feet high, skirting the road-side, so that the cater- 
pillars must almost invariably be buried in snow the winter 
through. 
The caterpillars are generally lighter colored than 
those of the preceding species. but resemble them wonderfully. 
The first caterpillar changed to chrysalis the night of June 7th, 
and emerged the morning of the 18th. 
Polygonia Faunus. The butterfly was very abundant, the 
males far exceeding the female 
in number; the latter were 
apparently not yet prepared to deposit their eggs. 
Polygonia grc~cilis. 
This butterfly was rather common, and 
what is strange, many more females than males were taken ; 
they could not be induced to lay eggs under muslin during my 
Psirhe 1 Oil-Wpre.1903). hfp //psyche aitclub org/1/1.0013 htd 




================================================================================


short visit, and died just after the journey home. One left be- 
hind in a muslin bag, on willow, was found a week afterward, 
by Mr. Whitney, to have died without depositing. 
Polygonia Progne. A single female was taken ; it has never 
before been found in this region. 
Nymphalis J-albwn. One or two specimens only were seen 
on the 4th, apparently just out of winter quarters ; they appear 
later, I believe, than other hibernating Prefect!, and these 
were seen on the sunny side of a barn, which had probably 
served as their winter refuge. 
Papilio Antiopa. 
Half a dozen specimens were seen. 
Aglais Milberti. A single female was taken. 
8. If. Scudder. 
ENTOMOLOGICAL EXCURSION TO WAVERLEY. - On the 7th of May 
the members of the Club, to the number of half a dozen, made an excur. 
sion to the vicinity of Waverley. The day proved unfavorable, as there 
was a raw wind which kept the insects out of sight, and very little was 
accomplished. 
Of Coleoptera very few specimens were taken, and those of common spe- 
cies, the most noteworthy being a specimen of Badister notatus, a species 
which is rare in this vicinity, and Diccelus elongatus, common about Waver- 
ley, though rare elsewhere in the vicinity of Boston. 
Of Lepidoptera Mr. Morrison obtained a perfect specimen of Anticlea 
rasiliata Guen., a species not common in this vicinity. 
Caterpillars of Basilarchia Disippe were obtained on three species of wil- 
lows, either eating the catkins for want of leaves, or still concealed in their 
hibernacula. The observations of the party showed that they hibernate 
both In the second and third stages, and that each makes a winter abode of 
just the size of its body, into which it crawls head foren~ost, and which it 
must vacate in the spring by a retreating movement. The caterpillar 
moults very soon after re-appearing, and one was found nearly half grown 
upon a twig still bearing only catkins. JS. P. Austin. 
VERNACULAR NAMES FOR BUTTERFLIES. - EDITOR PSYCHE : I very 
much approve of Mr. Scudder's list of vernacular names for our butterflies. 
Permit me to stand sponsor in your columns for the following : 
Calephelis borealis. - The large Metal-mark. 
Calephelis pumila. - The small Metal-mark. 
Feniseca Tarquinius. - The Wanderer. Aug. 3. Grote.

ON THE OCCURRENCE OF COCHINEAL IN THE "NORTHERN UNITED 
STATES. - In the northwestern part of Nebraska and the adjacent part of 
Dakota, are large areas thickly covered with several spgies of Cactaceae, 
on which I was surprised to find Cochineal in considerable quantities. As 
red paint is a favorite article of use among the Indians, I inquired of sev- 
eral men who were familiar with the Indians of the plains, bot)h Sioux and 
Pawnees, if the Indians mack! use of the cochineal, but none of them had 
ever seen or heard of its use. 
At that time the fact of the occurrence of this insect in such high lati- 
tudes was quite new to me, nor have I since seen any statement in print of 
its occurrence in the United States, except in southern California, though 
I have learned from collectors that it is not uncommon in Kansas and 
southwards. I have therefore tho~~glit a brief notice of the fact might be 
acceptable. 
The occurrence of this insect in such a region suggests a possible indus- 
try at some future time, .when the Great West shall be settled up, as in this 
region very little cm be cultivated, and if cochineal can be produced it 
may be worth trying. 
E . P. Austin.

English Names for Butterflies. 
(Continued frompage 11.) 
19. Papilio Adopa.- The Camberwell Beauty. 
The well known English name, worth importing, although local, and hav- 
ing a special significance for England only. It has also been called the 
Mourning Cloak, an expressive name, but translated from the German. 
20. Aglais Mi1berti.- The nettle Tortoise-shell. 
Called Milbert's butterfly by Harris, and the forked butterfly by Gosse, 
the last in allusion to the name given by Say. 
The caterpillar feeds, as is 
. well known, on nettle. 
21. Vanessa Atalanta- The red Admiral. 
The English name. 
22. Vanessa Huntem- The painted Beauty. 
A name well proposed by Gosse, indicating its relation to the next spe- 
cies. 
Harris simply called it Hunter's butterfly. 
23. Vanessa cardui- The painted Lady. 
The English name for this cosmopolitan butterfly. 
Harris called it the 
thistle butterfly. 
24. Junonia Coenia.- The Buckeye. 
Mr. Behrens says this is an English name for this insect. 
I have never 
heard of it, and give it only on his testimony.

A North Greenland Butterfly. 
The recent polar expedition of Captain Hall, in the U. S. 
Steamer Polaris, bought home from Polaris Bay, Lat. 81' 38' 
N., two specimens, male and female, of BrentMs polaris (Boisd.) 
- the most northern butterfly known. 
The male is badly rubbed, but evidently differs, as the fresher 
female does, from Labrador specimens, in being of a much duller 
- 
color upon both surfaces of the wings. 
The upper surface of 
the male, in Labrador specimens, is bright orange fulvous, that 
of the females a little duller; while in these Greenland exam- 
ples the color is a dull sordid fulvous, almost changing to ashen 
in the fore-wings of the female. The dark markings of the upper 
surface in both sexes are not so dark in the Greenland as in the 
Labrador specimens, and, with some exceptions, they are also 
slightly narrower ; the transverse markings in the cell of the fore 
wings in both sexes are noticeably slenderer, but the mesial band 
of the fore wings, besides being less irregularly zigzag, is broad- 
ened in the posterior half of the wing, at least in the female, and 
its border more obscured by scattered griseous scales ; the mesial 
- 
band of the hind wing is, however, narrower than in Labrador 
specimens, and there is therefore a greater extent of fulvous 
surface, but that is greatly obscured by griseous scales; the 
roundish spots of the extra-mesial row are rather larger than 
usual in the female. 
Beneath, similar differences occur. 
The general color is 
duller than on the upper surface, though not to so great an ex- 
tent, and the contrasts of the dark and bright markings are not 
so noticeable as in Labrador specimens. On the fore wings, the 
lower portion of the mesial band is broader, as on the upper 
surface, and the extra-mesial spots are also larger, especially

ORGAN OF THE CAMBRIDGE ENTO~OLOGICAL CLUB 
EDITED BY B. PICKMAN MANN. 
Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., July, 1875. [No. 15. 
- 
The Introduction of Danaida Plexippus into the 
Pacific Islands. 
[In a letter from Dr. Luther H. Giilick; with additional comments.] + 
Û÷b 1852, I returned, after eleven years' absence, to the 
Sandwich Islands, and my brother John drew my attention to 
the fact that the so-called American milk-weed (Asclepias) 
had, during my absence, been introduced, and had spread so 
rapidly as to be already ranked, in that tropic climate, with 
troublesome weeds. My brother had, early after its introduc- 
tion, notired that in whatever part-of the groupthe milk-weed 
appeared, there also what he called the milk-weed butterfly 
(Danaus) appeared ; a butterfly unknown on all the Sandwich 
Islands till after the introduction of the milk-weed. 
bb 111 1857, a number of choice plants were sent me at Pon- 
ape or Ascension Island of the Caroline Range, from Honolulu, 
by our small missionary brig of about one hundred tons bur- 
then, whose diminutive hold and cabin were several times ran- 
sacked in every corner before it reached our island, so that no 
such butterfly as the Danaus could easily have been concealed 
there. The plants were in glass-covered cases, as closely sealed 
from the air as it was possible to make them. The vessel sailed 
from Honolulu on the 24th of June, and reached Ponapc, two 
thousand miles or more from the Sandwich Islands, on the 18th 
of August, or after fifty-four days, several days after which the 
case was for the first time opened, thus making a period of about 
eight weeks from the time of its closure. On the voyage to 
Ponape, the vessel touched at Apaiang of the Gilbert Islands 
and Ebon of the Marshall Islands, both low coral atolls, where 
butterflies of any Idnd are all but unknown, and at Kusaie or 




================================================================================


Strong's Island, which is of basaltic formation and clothed with 
the most beautiful luxuriance of the tropics, but where, in a 
general way, I know that neither the above-mentioned milk- 
weed nor its accompanying butterfly were at that time to be 
found. 
"Some weeks after the plants had been opened on Ponape 
(I should think it must have been three or four months) there 
having meantime been no vessel from any other land, we discov- 
ered .several young plants of the milk-weedyspringing up in the 
earth in which various other plants had been brought from the 
Sandwich ~slands. These rnilk-weeds had evidently sprung 
from seeds in the Sandwich Island earth, as we found no plants 
of that kind after a most careful inspection of every item, when 
the case first arrived from Honolulu, and as they were plants 
till then unknown On Ponape, my brother Theodore and I set 
ourselves to watching whether or not the butterfly would ap- 
pear with it. The plants did not grow very rapidly or healthily, 
but just as several of them were beginning to develop flower 
buds, we discovered a swarm of small caterpillars of the Da- 
naus, of different sizes, but none of them apparently more 
than two or three days out of the egg, feeding on the leaves. 
This, of course, stimulated our curiosity exceedingly. We had 
to de'stroy a con4d~ra.ble portim. of the svarrn, PO is to 1:pcvre 
for the remainder nourishment sufficient from the five or six 
slender nncl stunted plants to permit of then* maturing, for we 
found that the caterpillars would feed on nothing else. In due 
time the chrysalids were formed. We took charge of them, 
showed them to the natives, and offered large rewards to any 
one who would bring us others of the same !;i~:cl, b2t thy did 
not and said they could not, for they were unknown on the 
island. In about two weeks the butterflies appeared, and we 
like rewards, with like results, regarding them, and as 
Ponape has but very few butterflies of any hind, we were sure 
they were something new. 
'6 We afterwards took a few of the seeds of the milk-weed, 
- 
carefully cleaned, to the opposite side of the island, twenty-five 
miles as we travelled round the shore, and there planted them. 
The plants, apparently now naturalized, grew very thriftily to 




================================================================================


the height of four or five-feet, and after some months the but- 
terfly appeared there also (it was the butterfly, I think, that 
was first noticed by my friends) and that too, before they had 
become common on the northeastern aide of the island, where 
they were first propagated, and long before they were found at 
any intermediate point. I am under the impression that the 
plant was subsequently introduced at Kusaie, and that the but- 
terfly also appeared there, but of this I am not personally cog- 
nizant. 
" Barceiffna, Spain, Ayri117,1873tt 
The above account was furnished by Rev. Dr. Gulick, at my 
request, for insertion in my work on New England Butterflies; 
but its special interest induces me to publish it independently. 
The butterfly in question is a species which abounds over the 
southern half of N. America and the northern half of S. 
America, including the intervening islands. In N, America, it . 
is single-brooded (not double-brooded, as asserted by Mr. Riley), 
the butterfly hibernating. It leaves its winter quarters later in 
the season than other hibernating butterflies and continues 
upon the wing until July and August, laying eggs all the time, 
so that the insect may be found in- its earlier stages throughout 
most of the summer. The eggs are deposited upon the under 
surface of leaves and hatch in four or five days; the caterpillar 
attains its fall growth in two or three weeks and the chrysalis 
hangs from nine to fifteen days. The earliest butterflies which 
have not hibernated may be found in New England in July; so 
that while the earlier stages we passed rapidly, the perfect 
insect lives a full year, mingling on the wing with its own prog- 
eny and witnessing the decay and renewed growth of the plant 
which nourished it; for the Asclepias dies early and is not euffi- 
&ntly grown to support the caterpillars of Danaida when the 
first butterflies appear in the spring. 
The butterfly has extraordinary powers of flight and has been 
seen fifteen or twenty miles from land ; when several are sport- 
ing together they are described as " gyrating in a wild manner 
at all heights, " some so far up that they appear 46 but as moving 
specks in the sky. " But it would be utterly absurd to presume 




================================================================================


that this butterfly could have traversed two thousand miles of 
ocean, and in addition have appeared on a11 island less than 
twenty miles in diameter almost simultaneously with a few 
plants of Asclepias, accidentally introduced ! The only other 
alternative is to suppose that it was carried to the island with 
the box of plants sent to Dr. Gulick. But the precise manner 
of its introduction is still a perplexing question. In a vast ma- 
jority of cases the accidental transportation of insects from one 
country to another is during their preparatory stages ; but in 
this case the voyage is known to have taken nearly eight weeks, 
while the transformations of the Danaida, even in a temperate 
country, seldom occupy more than four or five weeks, and in 
the tropics doubtless take less time. So that, should a plant 
of the Asclepias weed, bearing eggs of the Danaida just laid, 
have been accidentally introduced into the Wardian case sent 
to Dr. Gulick, the butterflies would certainly have appeared in 
the closed case before the voyage was half over ; and we must 
suppose that the caterpillars from which they were produced 
had eaten up every trace of Asclepias, that the butterflies 
themselves remained therein unseen for a month, and that at 
least a pair of them made their escape unnoticed from the ease 
on its arrival at Ponape. 
* 
This seems quite impossible. 
And although Dr. Gulick dis- 
tinctly says that the " diminutive hold and cabin " of the vessel 
"were several times in every corner before it readied 
our island, so tliat no such butterfly as the Danaus could 
easily have been concealed there," this seems to be the only 
other alternative, and one which the long duration of this 
stage of the insect and its power of extended hibernation 
directly favor. In this case we must suppose that a pregnant 
female flew into the hold (to rest for the night) while the ves- 
. 
el was loading at Honolulu and, undergoing a forced imprison- 
ment (or pseudo - hibernation) during the voyage, escaped on 
unlading and in course of time found Asclepias ready for its 
necessities. A single butterfly, even of the great size of Dan- 
aida Plexippns would easily escape observation flying at large 
about a wooded tropical island. Samuel H. Scudder.

On the Insect Fauna of the White Mountains. 
Mr. Grote, in an article Lb On the Insect Fauna of the White 
Mo~mtains," in PSYCHE for last month, writes as follows: L6 On 
comparing it (Agrotis scropulana, Morr.) with three speci- 
mens of Pachnobia carnea, Thunb., from Labrador, it seems to 
me probable that a larger series may show that the species are 
the same," and " I have a single specimen (of Agrotis opipara, 
Morr.) from the White Mountains, of which my determination 
is not absolute, but I believe it to be the species, since it came 
from Mr. Morrison, though unnamed. If so, I think we have 
to do with A. islandica." 
In making synonymical corrections, we want certainties, not 
probabilities, and it is '' obviously unsafe " to make or to insin- 
uate such corrections on the scanty and doubtfully determined 
material, which Mr. Grote states he possesses. I will mention 
that the four species named are entirely distinct from each 
other ; and that, in working on my paper on the genus Agrotis, 
my material of them consisted of thirty Pachnobia carnea, from 
Labrador, and one from the White Mountains, bred by myself; 
six specimens each of Agrotis scropulana and opipara, all bred 
from the larvae ; and three specimens of Agrotis islandica, lent 
me by Dr. Packard. 
In Pachnobia carnea there is no basal black dash, and the 
reniform spot is obsolete ; in Agrotis scropdana the basal 
dash is very large, black and distinct, and the claviform spot is 
long, clear ell ow and conspicuous ; in the former the interior 
line is oblique and outwardly undulate, in the latter it is very 
strongly drawn in, sometimes touching the basal dash. Agrotis 
islandica and opipara do not bear any resemblance to each 
other; the gound color is entirely different; the former is a 
dull gray inconspicuous species, with fine and interrupted mark- 
ings, the latter is entirely cinereous, with distinct heavy black 
markings. I do not think it necessary to give other points of 
difference, as those pointed out above are amply sufficient to 
separate the insects. 
B. K Morrison.

================================================================================


1 went'with Dr. Waters to Pleasant Street in Newton, on the 
grounds of Mr. Davis, of the firm of Hallett & Davis, piano- 
forte makers, near the Cochituate Aqnednct, where we found 
thii-four more, one of which was black. We did not get upon 
the ground till 9 o'clock, P. M,, or later, when it was quite dark 
and moonless. The larvae seemed to be stHI emerging from the 
punif, as after taking all I could find at one time in a place I 
afterwards found more there. These larvse shine with a bright 
light from their spiracles and the membrane between the rings, 
which discovers them at a distance of some mds. 
T found them 
mostly near the rocrts of the grass, under or near an evergreen 
hedge and also a " hck-thorn " hedge, hut some at_a consider; 
able distance from the hedge, in m owhard. Dr- Water8 found 
some nnder pine tree3 cm a k h knoII near by. The whole 
locality vas rather high and dry, no dew being on the ground, 
nor had there been a dew for several 'weeks. 
KO larvse were 
found near the brook which nms by the orchard, 
On the evening of the 28th of July we went with two friends 
to the same locality in Newton where we had found the tinrtp - 
four larva 
There, and on the lane entering Homer Street 
opposite Mr. E. F. Waters', and on the side of Centre Street, 
we found twenty more la-, fgur of which were quite Mack ; 
the others yellow. All were on the average smaller than those 
black ones nearly of the same size with each 
f July, I obtained permission to 
examine the grounds of Mr. J. R, Lowell, near Mt. Auburn, 
in Cambridge. There, mder or near pine trees, I cauglit thirty 
more larvse, fourteen of winch were black; the rest yellow. 
On the evening of the 6th of Auga'it I honted long and dili- 
gently for more of. these larvae in Mr. Lew+eII's grounds, but 
found none. 
z 
Thus in one month we found eighty yellow and nineteen 
black luminous Coleopterous larvae. Some ofthege'afterwards 
escaped, some I preserved in alcohol, some died of unknown 
causes, but on the 2d of August I had forty-eight living yellow 
ones and eighteen living black ones in my jar's of earth. The 
last of thwe died in Novemb f them haying pupated. 




================================================================================


Since the occurrences narrated above, I have made many 
inquiries about similar larvae, and, have only learned that Mr. 
Sanborn found three or four larvae apparentlyidentical with one 
of the above, by the roadside between West Roxbury and Ded- 
ham. The first he had seen were brought him in 1862, by E. 
- 
S. Rand, Jr., who found them in Dedham. 
The most abundant form of these larvae differs so little from 
the third species " of unknown larvas described by Osten- 
Sacken in vol. i of the Proceedings of the Entomological Soci- 
ety of Philadelphia, p. 129, that I think it sufficient only to 
describe the differences. 
* 
This is No. 3074 of my collection. 
It is 85 mm. long, elon- 
gated, with the first five rings behind the small head success- 
ively widening, the last three rings almost insensibly narrowing, 
the last ring evenly rounded ; of a soft-leathery consistence. 
Lateral margins of alt the abdominal segments and sometimes of 
the thoracic ones, the whole venter, and sometimes alao the 
front and hind margins of the thoracic segments yellowish. 
Head retractile, well exserted when in walking, transverse, 
dilated rnedially behind, dark brown or almost black, sometimes 
paler on the margins. Anterior margin of the head above 
between the bases of the mandibles bisinaated, the forward 
projections of the curve being lateral, and the hollow central 
and broader. Below, directly over the mouth, the margin is 
truncate, centrally notched. No separate clypeus or labrum 
distinguishable. Third joint of antennae cylindrical, twice as 
long as broad, one-third aa long as the second joint, with no 
trace of a fourth joint in most casea. Ma11dIbles strongly 
curved, either one outermost. So-called Lb second appendage " 
of the maxilla? indistinguishable. Third and fourth joints of 
maxillary palpi usually at least as long as they are broad. 
Prothorax, when ex tended, as broad, anteriorly as the head, 
longitudinal, posteriorly twice as broad as the head. Mesotho- 
rax and metathorax nearly equal in length, the latter a little 
longer ; each shorter than prothorax. Punctuation of die tho- 
rax dmost none. Tips of cox= not very approximate, the po5 
terior ones less &qmximate. Hind legs not much larger than 
the others and having abo'nt the same proportions. All the 




================================================================================


legs spiny and * bristly, but with no complete rings of spines, 
Abdominal segments not very different in length, but their 
relative lengths not very definite. Pseudopod a flattened trun- 
cated cone, of homogeneous fleshy texture ; exsertile tip bitu- 
berculate or bifurcate. 
No. 3075 of my collection, one specimen, is the dead larva 
given me by Dr. Waters, July 9. Dr. Waters assured me 
that all the larvae in this lot were luminous, and as they were 
collected in the evening, they must have been so, yet this larva 
has a broader head actually and proportionally, short stout 
mandibles dilated and bent at a right angle in the middle, max- 
illary palpi not tapering, short and stout, rounded at the end, 
the third and fourth joints forming a mass of oval outline three 
times as long as either the first or second ; the labial palpi short 
and stout, approximate; and other differences which I will not 
dwell upon with my present material. 
The black larvae make a third form, of which I find no speci- 
mens preserved in my collection, and did not take a particular 
description. They differ markedly in being able or apt to 
extinguish their light at times, which none of the yellow larvse 
did, and then to resume it. They are- much more active than 
the others, and smaller. I 
What else I have to say refers to the first larvas described. 
They are quite active, and I should judge from the structure of 
their jaws that they are carnivorous. 
I did not succeed in 
feeding them with meat, earthworms, slugs, larvae, leaves, nor 
slices of potato. They were in the habit of descending below 
the surface of the ground in the daytime, or sometimes remain- 
ing coiled up on the surface. Numbers congregated in the day 
time under a piece of tin or a slice of potato. 
They generally 
formed passages in the earth, with "chambers, in which they 
rested singly. At night they moved about upon the surface. 
I did not determine whether artificial darkness would arouse 
them in the daytime. At night they were attracted to the side 
of the jar nearest artificial light. When disturbed, they roll 
themselves up with the head applied to the ventral surface of 
about the sixth ring, and with the terminal segment reaching 
the back of about the third ring ; the head is then withdrawn 




================================================================================


almost entirely within the prothorax, so that at most the man- 
dibles, tip of mentum and palpi project beyond the prothorax. 
When picked up, they give quite a cold sensation to the touch. 
Sometimes they emit a blackish fluid from the mouth, in the 
manner of locusts. Erroneously, according to the claims of 
priority, although the error is more appropriate than the truth, 
they are commonly called " glow-worms." By the suggestion 
and indications of Mr. E. P. Austin, I conjecture that they 
are the larvae of Asaphes rnmnonius. B. Pickman Mann. 
The Note of the Katydid. 
Since I began to study the character of the notes produced 
by different species of Orthoptera, it has been my fortune to 
hear that of the true Katydid (Cyrtophyllus concavus) but once. 
This insect lives in tree tops, one or two only in a tree, in little 
colonies scattered here and there over most of the United States 
east of the Rocky Mts. One such colony I encountered in the 
heart of the city of Springfield, Mass., and spent an evening en- 
deavoring to reduce the notes to scale. The insects which I 
observed were from fifteen to twenty rods distant, perched in 
the tops of maple, cherry and elm trees, not far above my 
window. 
They ordinarily call " Katy, " or say " she did, " rather than 
u Katy did"; that is, they rasp their fore wings twice, more 
frequently than thrice ; these two notes are of equal (and 
extraordinary) emphasis, the latter about one quarter longer 
' 
than the former ; or, if three notes are given, the first and sec- 
ond are alike and a little shorter than the last; the notes are 
repeated at the rate of two hundred per minute; and while 
the interval between two series of notes varies to a certain 
degree, it is seldom greater than two and one-third seconds, or 
less than a second and a quarter ; usually it is between one and 
seven-eighths and two seconds. The accompanying cut, in which 
each bar represents a second of time, attempts to reduce this to 
a scale.

The note, which sounds like xr, has a most shocking lack of 
melody; the poets who have sung its praises must have heard it 
at the distance that lends enchantment ; in close proximity the 
sound is excessively rasping and grating, louder and harsher 
than I have heard from any other of the Locustarians, the 
noisiest of all Orthoptera. 
Since these creatures are abundant 
wherever they occur, the noise produced by them, on an even - 
ing especially favorable to their song, is most discordant. Usu- 
ally, as I have said, the notes are two in number, rapidly 
repeated, at short intervals ; perhaps nine out of ten individuals 
will ordinarily give this number ; but, occasionally, a stubborn 
insect persists in sounding the triple note ; aLd as Katydids 
appear desirous of answering their neighbors in the same meas- 
- - 
we, the proximity of a treble-voiced songster demoralizes a 
whole neighborhood, and a curious medley results ; notes from 
some individual may then be heard all the while, scarcely a 
moment's time intervening between their stridulations, some 
nearer, others at a greater distance ; so that the air is filled by 
these noisy troubadours with an 
indescribably confused and 
grating clatter. This renders special observation of the notes 
of any individual all the more difficult, and it is only by great 
ptiekce and careful selection that it can be acc&nplished, 
unless one places himself upon the outskirts of a colony.

donewoptera and Neuroptera 11ad bee13 co1lected this year, 
some by himself in &fassachusetts, and some by Mr. Sanborn 
in Kentucky. Amongst these are CaZop~enjx angust$e?znis 
and PetaZwa Fhoreyi. 
The two other species of 
Petalura 
known belong to New Holland. This genus is so exceptional 
that the first specimen of the American species was declared 
by Selys to be of necessity A~~stralian and erroneously labelled. 
Some larvze from the same locality and collector probably 
belong to Petalura. By the dilated aiitem~ they agree, with 
the larva of IZagenius. Two Aeschna fuycillata were caught 
in Manchester, Mass. Onlay one specimen is known to exist in 
Europe. A specimen of Neuronk pctrdalis was also capt~~red. 
The only nearly related species live in Japan, the northern 
part of Europe and ~JI Siberia. They have the pecdiarity to 
fly very higli ; this specimen was taken on top of a stage-coach. 
Dr. Hagen farther obtained a Heinerobid of the genus Dila 
from Kentucky : the male with pectinated antennze, the female 
with a long ovipositor like that of Rhaphidia. Two species are 
known from Enrope and two from Asia, viz : one from Ceylon 
and one from India.

ORGAN OF 
THE CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB 
EDITED BY B. PICKMAN MANN. 
Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., October, 1875. [No. 18. 
The Chirp of the Mole-cricket. 
The common mole-cricket of the United States (Gryllotalpa 
borealis Burm.) usually commences its daily chirp at about four 
o'clock in the afternoon, but stridulates most actively at about 
dusk. On a cloudy day, however, it may be heard as early as 
two or three o'clock ; this recognition of the weather is rather 
remarkable in a burrowing insect, and the more so since it does 
- 
not appear to come to the surface to stridulate, but remains in 
its burrow usually an inch below the surface of the ground. 
The European mole-cricket is said to chirp both within its bur- 
row and at its mouth (plerumque sul terrd, Fischer says), and 
it may be that our species sometimes seeks the air in chanting; 
but the chirp, as far as I have heard it, always has a uniformly 
subdued tone, as if produced in some hidden recess. Fischer 
says that the European species, which is twice as large as ours, 
cannot be heard more than from one hundred and fifty to two 
hundred feet (ultra spatiurn 20-30 passuum). Ours, when 
certainly beneath the surface, is easily distinguished at a dis- 
tance of five rods; and one would presume that it could be 
heard, if above ground, nearly twice as far away. 
Its chirp is a guttural sort of sound, like grit or pi-&, re- 
peated in a trill indefinitely, but seldom for more than two or 
three minutes, and often for a less time. 
It is pitched at two 
octaves above middle C, and the notes are usually repeated at 
the rate of about 130 or 135 per minute; sometin~es, when 
many are singing, even as rapidly as 150 per minute. Often,

Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., March, l87'6. [No. 23. 
List of Coleoptera collected in Michigan in 1874. 
Among a large number of species of Coleoptera collected in 
Michigan by Mr. H. G. Hubbard and myself, during the year 
1874, those mentioned in the following list will be found of 
some interest. Where no locality is given, the species were 
collected in the vicinity of Detroit. 
Omopkron robusturn Horn. 
A single specimen on the shore of Lake Erie 
near Monroe, in September. 
Schizogenius ferruginous Putz. 
With the preceding, not rare. 
Dtcaelus purpuratus Bon. 
The larva of this species is very beautifully 
colorcd, and was found in rotten logs, in the middle of August; it under- 
goes its transformation in this place, and the imago appears about the be- 
ginning of September. 
Bembidium antfuliferum Led1 Very rare under decaying leaves; pre- 
viously found only in California. 
Hydroporus rotundatus Lee. In the Detroit River, rare. 
Helophurus intervulatus Gyllh. 
Not common near Detroit. 
Philhydrus consors Lee. Much rarer than Ph. cinctus Say. 
Cercyon unipunctaium Linn. and C. centrimaculatun St. Not rare, on the 
window of a stable, in October. 
Cercyon naviculare Zimm. Abundant in decaying fungus. 
Ndssidium americanum Mots? In a kind of Polyporus not rare in July. 
Rilium Collani Makl. 
Common in decaying fungus. 
Smicrusjlicornis Fairm. Under decaying hay, in October, not rare. 
Pterp balteata Lee. 
In rotten wood and sphagnum moss, not rare. 
Ptinclla quercus Lee. Under old bark of oak, elm and other trees, common. 
Homalota Mannh. To give some idea of the number of species of this 
1 For the determination of this and many of the following species I am indebted to 
Dr. Leconte. 
1 It may he not without interest to state that a species of Motschulskium, very prob- 
ably identical with M. s~uatocolle Matth., was found abundantly by Mr. Crotch at 
San Diego, Gal., under seaweed. 




================================================================================


genus, inhabiting the United States, it may be stated that about sixty spe- 
cies were found in the vicinity of Detroit in a single season. 
Calodera Mannh. 
Of this genus, which is very easy to recognize, three 
species were found near Detroit; three others are not rare in the marshes 
near Cambridge, Mass.; all the species live under very wet decaying 
leaves and moss. 
Oligota pedalis Lee. Very rare under decaying leaves. 
Myllaena fuscipennis Kr. Not rare under stones, etc., near the Detroit Riv. 
Dinopsis americana Kr. Under decaying leaves in fall and winter, not rare. 
'' myllaenoldes Kr. With the preceding, but much rarer. 
Tachyporus nanus Er. aud T. maculipennis Lee. Both are common in 
the grass at the foot of old oak trees. 
Tachyporus affinis Kirb. Rare in decaying fungus. 
Conosoma Knoxii Lee. Not rare in fungus, in the fall. 
Bolifobius niger Grav. 
Very rare in fungus. 
Bryoporus rufescens Lee., B. testaceus Lee., Mycetoporus lepidus Grav., 
M. americanus Er. and M. lucidulus Lee., occur rarely under decaying 
leaves ; M. flavicollis Lee. is common in the same localities. 
Heterothops fumigatus Lecl 
Common under decaying leaves. 
" push Lee. Very rare. 
Philonthus Uandus Grav. and Ph. laefulus Say are two quite distinct spe- 
cies; both are to be found not rarely in fungus. 
Xantholinus cephalus Say. Common under bark of several kinds of trees. 
Thinobius Kr. A single specimen of an undescribed species was found by 
sweeping on a swampy meadow; a second species occurs in California. 
Trogophloeus Maunh. 
This genus seems to be very rich in species, fif- 
teen or sixteen species being observed by us near Detroit. 
Isomalus pallidus Lee. 
A single specimen in a little ditch, after a heavy 
rainstorm. 
Pseudopsis sulcata Newm. .Several specimens in decayingffungus. 
Bythinus zonatus Br. Two specimens sifted from sphagnum moss. 
Trimium dub Lee. 
Not very rare under dry old leaves.

set, in the latter part of June. 
Anogdus laevis Lee. 
Several specimens under old bark, in August. 
Clambus puberulus Lee. On a window of a stable, not rare, in August. 
Orthoperus glciber Lee. and two other species of the same genus, by

PSYCHE. 
A CONTRIBUTION TOWARD A KNOWLEDGE. OF THE LIFk 
HISTORY OF CULEX SOLLICITANS. PLATE 1. 
BY JOHN S. SMITH, NFW BRUSSWICK, K, J 
The life history of a mosquito is ordinarily supposed to be rather a simple 
affair, and when egg, larva, pupa, and adult arc known and the stage in which the 
winter is passed, it is assumed that little more remains to be learned. Yet of at 
least one species this is so little true, that our knowledge of the ordinary life cycle 
is a mere introduction to a real history of the species. 
The species referred to is Cnlex so/Z/c/å´'/ Wlk., which breeds abundantly 
along the shore districts in New Jersey, and which I have had under close obser- 
vation during a portion of the season of 1901, and almost the entire season of 1902. 
Yet after carefully reviewing the results of the work clone and the observations made, 
it appears that there is at least one full season's work yet required to clear up the 
questions left unsolved or raised by what has been already learned, 
The salt-marsh mosquito is, from the economic standpoint, the most important 
species that occurs in New Jersey, and it is of New Jersey conditions that I intend 
to speak here. 
It dominates the entire southern half of the 
Slate and occurs in 
swarms where there is no chance of mosquito breeding for miles about, except in 
casual rain pools - and there the larva is never found. 
1 do not mean to contra- 
dict observations made elsewhere, or lo question conclusions drawn from such 
observations : I mean only to state actual facts and the deductions I make from 
them! It is quite possible that elsewhere, under other climatic conditions, these 
deductions may piove incorrect ; but it will need equally extensive observations to 
demonstrate this. 
The species passes the winter in the egg stage. 
This is demonstrated nega- 
tively by a failure to find adults at any time during the winter in quarteis whore 
the species is dominant, and where other species of CULEX and ASOPHELES may 
be found. 
Positively it is proved by the tact that very early in spring; swarms of 
minute larvae appear in winter-filled pools, as soon as the temperature reaches 50' 
Fahrenheit or over, and when not an adult can be found on the closest search. 
Early in April (4) larvae pretty well grown were found in Cape May County 
in pools, high above ordinary or even summer storm tides, formed by the heaviest

winter storms and already drying down. These were fotind after a day of search 
for adults in which Culexpunge/is and (probably) C rest-nans and Anophelespuiicfi- 
pennis were found; but no C. so/Zic//ans. The same story was repeated on the 
11th; and on the 19th and zoth, as the advance of the season cut off pools and 
ditches from tide connection, it was quite interesting to watch the appearance of 
the baby larvae in pool after pool and ditch after ditch. 
A pool in which on the afternoon of the 18th there was no trace of larvae, 
about which not an adult could be stirred up, swarmed with minute larvae on the 
morning of the 19th. They had hatched during the night, from eggs that were 
already in the water and that required only the proper temperature to bring them 
out. This pool had been severed from the tide not over 48 hours and the result- 
ing uniformity of temperature was sufficient to produce the proper condition tor 
the larval life. At this time the temperature of the sea water in a creek at halt 
tide was po. The temperature of the pools in which the young larvae appeared 
was 5z0, and the older pools in which larvae were nearly full grown were at s4", 
all I"ahrenheit. 
A very suggestive condition of affairs was found in a low meadow well above 
tide level, which had become filled with snow and rain and by drainage and formed 
a shallow pond about 4 acres in area. 1 know positively that this area was dry 
except in one low corner during the entire season of 1901 between May 1st and 
September I sth, and 1 am informed and believe that it remained dry until late 
December. 
At all times during the summer the meadow swarmed with C. so/Zici- 
tans and now, April 18, 1902, this entire area was inhabited by larvae of that 
species already nearly full grown; some, indeed, in the more sllallow areas were 
already in the pupal stage. Obviously the eggs must have been laid in the dry 
meadow during the summer, for at no time when mosquitoes were flying was there 
any water to lay them into. 
A large number of adults was bred from larvae gathered from pools ot all 
kinds, ranging from fresh to vciy salt water and, except in one instance, only C. 
sollidtans was bred. The exception was a single lot of larvae from a pool of 
brackish water from which C cantans was also obtained. 
The larva of C. .so/licitnns is light slate gray in color, the head yellow, without 
markings of any kind, anal siphon short and stout, antenna short, slender, black at 
the tip, without obvious set off or prominent tufting. The figure (111. I, fig. I) shows 
very fairly the appearance of the larva; the shape of the head and especially of the 
vertex being quite characteristic. Several other larvae resemble this and are not 
readily separable - notably those of C. cantans and C. laeniorhy~~chus. 
What happened in Cape May County between April 20th and June isth, 
when next I went there, I am unable to say; but the season had been very dry, 




================================================================================


pools were everywhere much reduced, swarming with larvae and pupae, while thc 
grass was filled with males. There were very few females and evidently, of the 
new brood just coming to maturity, only the males had yet emerged. A month 
later only a few bodies of water remained and they were drying up fast - so fast 
indeed, that thousands of larvae failed to come to maturity, and the half or quarter 
inch of water remaining in some pools was one squirming, wriggling mass. 
A systematic search was now made for the eggs and they were found in quan- 
tity after the right places were determined. Of the older females, flying July 8-20, 
almost all contained eggs, ranging from soft, white, through pearly, translucent, as 
the shell formed. to b1:iclz. Black eggs only were found in the meadows, well above 
the recent water line of such pools as yet remained, in the black mud in which 
their color made them almost invisible. It has been recently snggestecl that black 
is an unusual or exceptional color for mosquito eggs and that the habit of ovipos- 
king on land rather than water is exceptional. This may be true for Louisiana 
where the observations leading to that suggestion were made; but in New Jersey 
C. sollicitam certainly lays black eggs in black mud. No other color would do so 
well under the circumstances ancl, outside the body of the mosquito, I never saw 
C. sollii-itam eggs other than black ! From a piece of sod about 4 inches square 
I washed the surface nrud into a basin of water, waited until the whole settled to 
the bottom, to make certain that the eggs did not float, and next morning J had 
over 300 and possibly 500 lively young wrigglers. 
It is important to note, in this connection, that though Mr. E. I,. Dickerson (my 
assistant) and I collected several hundreds of specimens of mosquitoes betwecn July 
8th and 20th no examples of C. fae~zio-~~h~v~c/z?~s were sccn, nor had I at any time 
previously in 1902 collected C. tmiorhynchiis near this point. Neither was that 
species bred out of any larvae taken from the pools where we were then experi- 
menting. 
Two large sods were cut out of the marsh, well above any recent pools, and 
these were carried to New Brnnswick to serve for laboratory tests. One sod was 
kept entirely dry, the other was kept constantly moist though never covered wit11 
water. The presence of eggs in both sods was demonstrated by actual examination 
and, at intervals, small pieces of sod were covered with water and the results were 
noted. From the dry sod larvae were always obtained in a short time-from one 
half to one hour; from the, wet sod no larvae were obtained ancl all the eggs 
found were burst. 
Two lots of larvae from the dry sod were bred to niatnrity and all the adults 
proved C. taetziorhynchii.s! The larvae were those of C. sol?icitans except that they 
seemed undersized ; but the adults were unquestionably the other species. Finally, 
September 21, two n~onths after I took it up, I placed the remnants of the moist sod

PSYCHE [February 
in a large dish of water and next morning, to my great surprise, I found a fair lot 
of larvae. 
Out of these I obtained 8 adults and of these three were undoubted 
so//i~~itms.' 
It is a fair suggestion that there is something yet to be learned con- 
cerning the relationship between C. soZ/icifms and C fae?zim+ydzzis. 
The season at the point where the collections were made was phenomenally 
dry and all pools and ditches remained dry until September 5 or 6, when a heavy 
storm filled everything. On the iitli, Mr. Dickerson investigated, found every 
pool swarming with recent larvae, and brought up 20 small sods from ten separate 
places well above the pool line and which had been entirely dry since early July 
and probably a month before that date. All but two of these sods had been tested 
and had shown the presence of eggs, hence it was a fair conclusion that eggs were 
generally distributed all over the meadow. From eight of these sods larvae were 
bred in the laboratory. 
The eggs are spindle shaped just a little curved, shining, and when the larva 
batches the upper & lifts off as if by a hinge. 
Anothe~ obseivation made ~t Beach Haven early in August ~IHOWS further 
light 11pon the egg-laying habits of the species. 
A very heavy rain after a long 
dry spell, followed by a series of shovicis ci~11-ing which 3 or 4 inches of rain fell, 
lillcd every low area in the meadows with from 5 to J$ inches of water. Within 
wenty-fonr hours this entire area was swarming with larvae jnsi hatched and in 
forty-eight hours millions had perished because the water had disappeared: evap- 
orated by the hot sun or soaked into the parched soil. It would be easy to add 
to this further observations, all tending to the point thai the Female oviposits 
almost anywhere in the meadows, at the base 01 grasses; but it would seen1 as if 
tlie above were sufficient. 
I stated that, in early J~ily, tlieie was no trouble in finding gravid females 
and: indeed, almost all the femalcs t.ilien nere full of eggs. 
It is a curious fact 
that this coridii-ion was not agri-in duplicated later in the season. 
Fiom the beginning of Septembel to the middle of October collections were 
made daily on the Newark meadows! and from that time to the end of mosquito 
flight in November, collections were made at least once'and usually twice a week. 
Yet of the many hundreds of examples dissected not one contained mature eggs. 
~ ~ 
After a long period of drought which left the upper part of the Newark n~eadows 
dry, C soi/icitous became very scarce in early September. 
On the night of the 
4th and 5th there was a very heavy tide that flooded the meadows to the edge of 
the City, and covered the marsh tract at the mouth of the Elizabeth River. On 
the 6th Mr. H. H. Brehme, who made the meadows investigations for me, found 
everything swarming with recently developed larvae which grew rapidly as the 
pools gradually dried up. By the 16th almost the entire brood was mature and 




================================================================================


the pools were crowded with pupae and a small proportion of full grown larvae. 
The grass was now full of adults which made life almost unbearable unless some 
method was used to keep them off. The practical disappearance of the earlier 
broods before the new brood issued fixed the age of these specimens and there 
was no oher general brood that developed later on these meadows. I thought 
this a good opportunity to ascertain how long a time it would require for eggs to 
develop and 11:nce had the collections made daily for some time. Vet. at the end 
of the season 1 had no evidence that even one example out of the entire brood laid 
even a single egg ! Lot after lot was received with absolutely undeveloped 
ovaries and not even a single example was found having eggs ready to be laid ! 
The question is, did they lay any at all? In sods collected after the water had 
drained off none were found, and practically I do not know ;vheie the eggs are 
that will start C. sdhci1ans next spring. Dr. Dyar has suggested, in connection with 
another species, that of eggs laid in spring' some might hatch during the summer 
but that others would lie over until the season following. It is, of course, possible 
that the same thing occurs in this case and th.it unhatched eggs are yet on the 
meadows, ready to develop under favorable conditions next spring. As to the 
number of eggs laid by a female, the dissections made gave an average of about 
17s. A very few reached 200 and very few had less than i,jo unless the n~unber 
was very small. 
Another peculiarity of C. siilfu-itens in New Jersey is, its habit of travelling 
long distances inland, either by flight or by allowing itself to bc carried by the pre- 
vailing winds. 
After the middle of July the entire pine region of South Jersey 
gradually fills up with these insects, sometimes swarming miles from any water and 
forty miles from any point where C. soliicitans larva has ever been found. On two 
occasions I made systematic search during two or three clays, over a large area 
where C. soZiicitans was the dominant species, finding larvae of forms whose adults 
escaped attention, but none of the shore species. Nor did I ever find in the pines 
even one adult example in which the ovaiies were at all developed. August 
idth, I captured 253 examples in one area in Ocean County, by sweeping so as to 
get old, inactive specimens, and not one of these had the ovaries in the least devel- 
oped. A lot of 90 was captured a few days before by picking [.hem from the coat 
of the collector and these were found in a similar undeveloped condition. I 
omitted to mention that in these flights, so far away from home, the males have no 
prt -only the females wander. It is quite certain that none of the millions of 
these mosquitoes that infest the Jersey pines ever reproduce, because the surround- 
ings are not suitable; and it is almost equally certain that they could not if they 
had the opportunitj7, because the ova simply do not develop. 
The life period of the individual of this species is not determined; but it is

probably of considerable length, especially in those forms that do not reproduce. 
that they may bite more than once is certain, and direct experiment has proven 
that a full meal of blood may be so completely digested in one week, that scarcely 
a trace remains. The examination of a large number of specimens seems to indi- 
cate that blood food stimulates ovarian development, for in the great majority of 
cases wliere I found fully developed ova I found also blood remnants. 
In those 
cases in which such remnants were not found it cannot be safely concluded that 
such food had not been taken more than a week previously. 
But I did find numer- 
ous instances of ova starting development where the alimentary canal contained 
only a colorless liquid; probably plant juices. 
Larvae of C. soliicitans were not found after November 4, but adults continued 
until well along in that month. In shelters along the Newark meadows where C. 
/~&ititSiis, another salt water species, was found hibernating, not a C. solliciians 
occurred in December. 
Altogether the life cycle of this species offers points of interest that will 
require at least another full year to work out.

CLASSIFICATION OF THE GALL-WASPS AND THE PARASITIC 
CYNIPOIDS, OR THE SUPKRFklbfILY CYNIl'OlI>EA. I. 
BY N'ILLIAM H. ASHUEAD, A. >I., ASSTSTANT CURATOR, U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUN. 
In 1899, the writer separated the Hymenoptera into tm s~iperfa~nilies, viz. - 
(7) Apoidea, (2) Sphecoklea, (3) Vespoidea, (4) F'ormicoideal (5) Proctotrypoidea, 
(6) Cynipoidea, (7) Chalcidoidea, (8) Ichneur~~onoidea, (9) Siricoidea, and (I 01 
Tentl~redinoidea, and all of these have been classified clown to genera, except the 
Formicoidea and the Cynipoidea. 
During the year 1903~ in a series of papers in PSYCHE, I propose to give my 
views on the classification of the Cynipoidea, a large, natural group falling in 
between the Proctotlypoidea and the Cl~alcidoidea, and still imperfectly known in 
this country, altl~oi~gli well represented in genera and species. 
An excellent ~isz47d of the va1-ious schemes of classification proposeu for these 
insects by Hartig, Giraud, Thornson, F6rster, Wa1sh7 and others is given by Cam- 
eron in his Monograph of the British pliytopliago~~s Hymenoptera, vol. 3, p, 152 ; 
also by Kieffer in his Monographic des cynipides d'Europe et d1Alg6rie, vol. I, p. 
5 I, so that I sliali not repeat them here ; they should be read by all interested in 
these wasps, as they show briefly the great progress made in the study and classifi- 
'cation of these obscure insects, and how the nafz~m/g~uzs~s have been gradually 
evolved, until to-day they are firmly establislied, whether they be called tribes, sub- 
familiesl or fainilies. 
Most writers on these insects consider that they represent but a single family, 
the Cynipidae, with many subfamilies. In my opinion, however, there are at least 
tze~o well-marked families, nearly as first pointed out by Hartig. one of these com- 
prises all the parasitic species ; the other, with the exception of a single gro~~p, the 
I~ah%zae, comprises the gall-makers and the gall-inhabiting species. The Ihaliiaae 
are, however, a peculiar group and may yet be elevated to family rank. 
The two families may be recognized by the use of the folfowing table : - 
Abdominal tergites meetin~a~or~~ the venter and entirely inclosing or concealing the 
sternites, at most with only a part of the hypopygium exposed, 
Family LVI 11. - Figitidae. 
Abdominal tergites not meeting along the venter ; all or nearly all the sternites 
visible. Family LIX. - Cynipidae.

[February 
Family LVIII, -- Figitidae. 
This family is a most extensive one and well represented in North America. 
The species are numcrous and all, without a single exception, are parasitic. 
The 
majority attack principally the 1a1mae of Diptera; a few, however, prey ~ p n 
aphides and coccicls; others attack the larvae of the lace-xinged flies (He~ncro- 
biidae) ; wllile otl~crs are said Lo pey upon beetle larvae. 
Several well-marked natural minor gronps may be recognized, as follows : - 
Abdomen ovate, compressed or subcon~prcssed, often longly petiolate, the apex 
usually pointed . I 
Abdomen short, globose or subglobose, the second segment the longest . 5

This snbfamily is quite distinct from all the other subfamilies here recognized 
except the Onychiinae with which it agrees in all particulars except in the shape 
of the second dorsal abdominal segment, the second segment being nor~ual and 
not produced dorsally, or tongue-shaped, as in the latter group. 
The shape of the scutellum easily separates it from the Encoilinae and the 
Xystinae (= Allotriinae), while Eso~n the Anacharinae and the Liopterinae it is dis-
